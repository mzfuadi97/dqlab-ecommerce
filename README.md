# E-commerce DQLAB Project

## Project at DQLab
In this project, I will demonstrate an end-to-end data analysis project for an e-commerce company. The data used in this project is from an e-commerce platform, and the user is a Business Analyst who wants to gain insights into the company's sales performance and customer behavior.

## Business Request & Demand Overview
In every data analytics/business inteliigence project, there must be a business request and demand overview from the user who will take advantage of the result/output. The user request for this project can be seen as below:
